# File Share Desktop Application
## Introduction
Sharing Files is a very simple task, but with all the apps containing advertisements, complex functionality and slow transfer speed, it becomes so cluttered and difficult to do this simple task.
With this File Share Desktop app, one can share files between the system on the go. You don't have to go through any signins or pop-ups, just run and share!
